# usps-sass-bootstrap
Remote repo for Bootstrap, modified for USPS using sass.

What's New?
=======================
-I've rebuilt the older version of the framework in Subverstion in Github. 
-This framework includes varibles for WCAG color combinations as noted in the documentation.
-I also removed the need to use the custom "USPS-STYLE" attribute. Those a styles are now handled with SASS variables and classes.
-I've added new colors based on the most current USPS style guide.


NOTE:
==========
I haven't added the the coustom icons and font libraries from the old version yet. They're on the way.
